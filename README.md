# Fractalnomia Simulation v1

## About Fractalnomia
Fractalnomia proposes that consciousness, memory, and structure are recursively generated across scales through self-similar dynamics. This simulation provides an early computational prototype of that idea.

## Features
- Consciousness Nodes: Complex recursion mappings
- Burst Embeddings: Latent node feature vectors
- Novelty Detection: PCA + Dynamic MAD Threshold
- Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest
- Harmonic Interference Mapping
- System Coherence Analysis

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the simulation: `python fractalnomia_simulation_v1.py`
3. View generated visualizations

## Future Directions
- Real-world bursts
- Recursive fields for adaptive AI training
- Interference-based learning models
